# toyml

This is a small toy implementation of a simple functional programming language
written in Standard ML (tested on Moscow ML).

So far, it only contains the type checker, which is heavily based on [Martin
Grabm√ºller's Haskell implementation of Algorithm W](http://catamorph.de/documents/AlgorithmW.pdf).
